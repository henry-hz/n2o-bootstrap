BOWER 
===== 


Meanwhile, all the vendor files were copied from angular-app vendor's folder 
but if you want to user bower, here it's a bower.json file and a .bowerrc 
config file ready for use, and pointing to output in a 'vendor' foler. 

Notice if you user bower, you will have to change less files, once bower 
adds more folders into the directory tree. 

Another option is to download them here and copy/paste to vendor directory 
once the .gitignore is already set to ignore the vendor folder in this dir.
